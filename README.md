Pytorch implementation for multimodal image-to-image translation. For example,  given the same night image, our model is able to synthesize possible day images with different types of lighting, sky and clouds. The training requires paired data.

## Prerequisites
- Linux or macOS
- Python 2 or 3
- CPU or NVIDIA GPU + CUDA CuDNN


## Getting Started ###
### Installation
- Clone this repo:
```bash
git clone -b master --single-branch https://github.com/junyanz/BicycleGAN.git
cd BicycleGAN
```
- Install PyTorch and dependencies from http://pytorch.org
- Install python libraries [visdom](https://github.com/facebookresearch/visdom), [dominate](https://github.com/Knio/dominate), and [moviepy](https://github.com/Zulko/moviepy).   

For pip users:
```bash
bash ./scripts/install_pip.sh
```

For conda users:
```bash
bash ./scripts/install_conda.sh
```


### Use a Pre-trained Model
- Download some test photos (e.g., edges2shoes):
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_testset.sh edges2shoes
```
- Download a pre-trained model (e.g., edges2shoes):
```bash
bash ./pretrained_models/download_model.sh edges2shoes
```

- Generate results with the model
```bash
bash ./scripts/test_shoes.sh
```
The test results will be saved to a html file here: `./results/edges2shoes/val/index.html`.

- Generate results with synchronized latent vectors
```bash
bash ./scripts/test_edges2shoes.sh --sync
```
Results can be found at `./results/edges2shoes/val_sync/index.html`.

### Generate Morphing Videos
- We can also produce a morphing video similar to this [GIF](imgs/day2night.gif) and Youtube [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvGysD2EFhw&t=2m21s).
```bash
bash ./scripts/video_edges2shoes.sh
```
Results can be found at `./videos/edges2shoes/`.

### Model Training
- To train a model, download the training images (e.g., edges2shoes).
```bash
bash ./datasets/download_dataset.sh edges2shoes
```

- Train a model:
```bash
bash ./datasets/train_edges2shoes.sh
```
- To view training results and loss plots, run `python -m visdom.server` and click the URL http://localhost:8097. To see more intermediate results, check out  `./checkpoints/edges2shoes_bicycle_gan/web/index.html`
- See more training details for other datasets in `./scripts/train.sh`.

### Datasets (from pix2pix)
